        Recently Patient Safety Goals have undergone extensive review. For
        instance Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations
        (JCAHO) has revised the National Patient Safety Goals (NPSG). We will
        help the hospitals continuously improve and comply with NPSGs as part of
        Standards Improvement Initiative (SII) through our well researched
        software portal’s information integration.

        It is reported that over 100,000 hospital deaths occur annually from
        medical errors. There also are additional charges such errors bring to
        the tune of $40 billion of which preventable errors contribute to some
        $16 billion. A comprehensive solution to patient safety has always been
        elusive while there have been sincere efforts to curb albeit in a
        piecemeal manner.{" "}

        This is partly due to absence of standard, bench mark performance
        parameters. USP 797 regulation is a far reaching regulation with a wide
        range of pharmacy policies and procedures. It is designed to reduce
        infections transmitted through pharmaceutical products and also to
        protect staff exposed to pharmaceuticals.

        Our services also include emergency management, worker safety, fire
        protection, environmental regulations, and much more. We can also help
        you in design, construction and operation of a new hospital or any
        expansion plans. Safety from Disasters - It is imperative to ensure that
        all new hospitals are built with a level of resilience that strengthens
        their capacity to remain functional in disaster situations and implement
        mitigation measures to reinforce existing health facilities,
        particularly those providing primary health care.
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        Hospitals represent an enormous investment for any country. Destruction
        or loss of functionality pose a major economic burden. Direct economic
        losses involve more than the structure: the cost of non-structural
        elements can be higher than the structure itself. Disasters produce an
        intensive demand for health services. In addition to treating disaster
        victims, hospitals must quickly resume treatment of everyday emergencies
        and routine care. The hospital network are integral components of a
        nation’s public health system. The long-term impact of losing these
        services is difficult to quantify and therefore may be overlooked.
        Disaster-resilient hospitals must be able to protect the lives of
        patients and staff and continue to function.
