        Recently, there has been a thorough examination of the Patient Safety
        Goals. Specifically, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare
        Organizations (JCAHO) has modified the National Patient Safety Goals
        (NPSG). Our AI-powered platform information integration feature will
        assist hospitals in ongoing enhancement and adherence to NPSGs as a
        component of the Standards Improvement Initiative (SII).

        As per the WHO records, approximately one out of every ten patients
        experiences harm in healthcare settings, leading to over three million
        deaths annually as a result of unsafe care. In low-to-middle-income
        countries, up to four out of every one hundred individuals succumb to
        the consequences of inadequate medical treatment.

        Our services cover emergency management, worker safety, fire protection,
        and more. We also help plan, build, and operate new hospitals. Disaster
        Resilience - New hospitals need to withstand disasters, ensuring they
        stay functional. We help mitigate risks and bolster existing healthcare
        facilities. Hospitals are a big investment for any nation and losing
        them is costly, including non-structural expenses. Natural disasters
        increase healthcare demand and hospitals also need to resume services
        quickly. This is crucial for public health systems as losing them has
        lasting effects. Resilient hospitals protect lives and maintain
        operations effectively.
