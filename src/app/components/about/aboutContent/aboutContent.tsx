          The team at MediQlogix feels that clinical quality and patient safety
          management are critical to a hospital’s ability to succeed
          financially. A hospital can decrease daily procedure costs, boost
          profitability by decreasing the length of stay (LOS), and lower
          re-admits by addressing clinical procedure errors before they arise.

          MediQlogix software utilizes evidence-based medicine concepts, guided
          by AI-enabled data analysis. It identifies missing quality data to
          take corrective action. The MediQM platform extends its reach beyond
          quality management to encompass financial performance, care
          management, and supply chain oversight, thereby enhancing the
          organization’s financial outcomes.
